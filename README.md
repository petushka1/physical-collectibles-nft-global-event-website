# Microverse Capstone Project
## Module 1

Build a Custom Website based on Template.

The subject chosen: NFT Global Event Presentation. Includes custom design created for this project.



## Built With

- CSS HTML
- Git version control system, Github workflows
- javascript



## Live Demo (if available)

[NFT Global Event Website](https://petushka1.github.io/physical-collectibles-nft-global-event-website/)



## Getting Started

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/repository
```
Create your feature branch

```
git checkout -b <new-branch>
```

You can use default Microverse linters set or configure linting rules

Expand .gitignore with more exceptions if needed
(add test files with .extension you'd like to be ignored by Git)

Customize template design.
Push your repository to GitHub.
(all graphics are open-source and free to use).

```
git add .
git commit -m "Commit description"
git push origin <your-branch>
```

Use Participants Section to customize your own dynamic list of cards.
- card is automatically generated and appended to document. To generate a new card you need to add a new Object to Array of Cards.

*Example:*

```
{
  image: 'img/photo5.png',
  alt: 'Saachi',
  name: 'Kevin Roberts',
  position: 'Former executive chairman of Saatchi & Saatchi and speaker',
  info: 'Mauris ut mauris fringilla, placerat dolor id, condimentum urna. Duis interdum arcu ut consectetur porttitor.',
}
```
- You will not be required for any extra manipulations to set up cards popups. Popup is generated and receives all data from the ```cardsArr``` item.
